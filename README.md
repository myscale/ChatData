Yet another chat-with-documents app, but supporting query over millions of files with [MyScale](https://myscale.com) and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/).

## News üî• (July-2023)

- ü§ñ LLMs are now capable of writing **Vector SQL** - a extended SQL with vector search! Vector SQL allows you to **access MyScale faster and stronger**! This will **be added to LangChain** soon! ([PR 7454](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/7454))
- üåè Customized Retrieval QA Chain that gives you **more information** on each PDF and **answer question in your native language**!
- üîß Our contribution to LangChain that helps self-query retrievers [**filter with more types and functions**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/how_to/self_query/myscale_self_query)
- üåü **We just opened a FREE pod hosting data for ArXiv paper.** Anyone can try their own SQL with vector search!!! Feel the power when SQL meets vector search! See how to access the pod [here](#data-service).
- üìö We collected about **2 million papers on arxiv**! We are collecting more and we need your advice!
- More coming...

## Quickstart

1. Create an virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

> This app is currently using [MyScale's technical preview of LangChain](https://github.com/myscale/langchain/tree/preview). 
>> 
>> It contains improved SQLDatabaseChain in [this PR](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/7454)
>> 
>> It contains [improved prompts](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/6737#discussion_r1243527112) for comparators `LIKE` and `CONTAIN` in [MyScale self-query retriever](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/6143).

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app!

```python
# fill you OpenAI key in .streamlit/secrets.toml
cp .streamlit/secrets.example.toml .streamlit/secrets.toml
# start the app
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

    client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(
        host='msc-1decbcc9.us-east-1.aws.staging.myscale.cloud',
        port=443,
        username='chatdata',
        password='myscale_rocks'
    )
    ```


## Introduction

Database credentials:

```toml
MYSCALE_HOST = "msc-1decbcc9.us-east-1.aws.staging.myscale.cloud"
MYSCALE_PORT = 443
MYSCALE_USER = "chatdata"
MYSCALE_PASSWORD = "myscale_rocks"
```

ChatData brings millions of papers into your knowledge base. We imported 2.2 million papers with metadata info, which contains:

1. `id`: paper's arxiv id
2. `abstract`: paper's abstracts used as ranking criterion (with InstructXL)
3. `vector`: column that contains the vector array in `Array(Float32)`
4. `metadata`: LangChain VectorStore Compatible Columns
    1. `metadata.authors`: paper's authors in *list of strings*
    2. `metadata.abstract`: paper's abstracts used as ranking criterion (with InstructXL)
    3. `metadata.titles`: papers's titles
    4. `metadata.categories`: paper's categories in *list of strings* like ["cs.CV"]
    5. `metadata.pubdate`: paper's date of publication in *ISO 8601 formated strings*
    6. `metadata.primary_category`: paper's primary category in *strings* defined by ArXiv
    7. `metadata.comment`: some additional comment to the paper
  
*Columns below are native columns in MyScale and can only be used as SQLDatabase*

5. `authors`: paper's authors in *list of strings*
6. `titles`: papers's titles
7. `categories`: paper's categories in *list of strings* like ["cs.CV"]
8. `pubdate`: paper's date of publication in *Date32 data type* (faster)
9. `primary_category`: paper's primary category in *strings* defined by ArXiv
10. `comment`: some additional comment to the paper

And for overall table schema, please refer to [table creation section in docs/self-query.md](docs/self-query.md#table-creation).

If you want to use this database with `langchain.chains.sql_database.base.SQLDatabaseChain` or `langchain.retrievers.SQLDatabaseRetriever`, please follow guides on [data preparation section](docs/vector-sql.md#prepare-the-database) and [chain creation section](docs/vector-sql.md#create-the-sqldatabasechain) in docs/vector-sql.md
